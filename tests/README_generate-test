You can generate test scripts from screenshots as following:

$ ./testshell.sh

You'll be in a special test environment with an empty todo.txt
and the dates and timestamps will be artificially fixed.

Then the session can be used to make a unit test thanks to test_todo_session,
see the existing tests as examples.

Be careful to replace all occurences of the full path to the test directory
by $HOME as testshell.sh will explain you when you execute it otherwise the
tests will work properly only on your own computer.

Don't use "script" as this would log every keystroke, not only what's visible!!
