You can generate test scripts from screenshots as following:

generate-test.awk is a AWK script parsing a screenshot and creating an executable bash script

To create the snapshot, change your prompt into something easily parseable:
$ PS1=">>> "

Then simply type your todo.sh commands
Be careful to start with an empty todo.txt otherwise item numbers won't match
You can insert comments in your session by starting with a #

>>> #Adding
>>> todo.sh add test
TODO: 'test' added on line 1.
>>> #Prioritizing
>>> todo.sh pri 1 a
1: (A) test
TODO: 1 prioritized (A).

then copy/paste the session in a file, let's say mytests.txt
Don't use "script" as this would log every keystroke, not only what's visible!!

then generate a script from it:

$ cat mytests.txt | ./generate-test.awk > mytests.sh

Script which you can run:

$ bash mytests.sh
*   ok 1: Adding
*   ok 2: Prioritizing
* passed all 2 test(s)

Some notes on the session content:
Blank lines are ignored.
The output can contain variable elements.
There is not yet a generic support of the "..." for those parts, only a few by hand:
- absolute location of todo.txt must be replaced by "...todo.txt"
- absolute location of todo.sh  must be replaced by "...todo.sh"
- date yyyy-mm-dd must be replaced by "..."
- time hh:mm:ss   must be replaced by "..."

See also testsuite_example.txt which is based on the original testsuite of Gina.
It can be tested as follow:
$ cat testsuite_example.txt | ./generate-test.awk > testsuite_example.sh
$ bash testsuite_example.sh
